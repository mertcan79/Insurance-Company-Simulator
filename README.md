# Insurance Company Simulator

An Insurance Company Simulator which creates Insurance Company and IORP classes, calculates risk metrics for them and creates interactions between the two.

The insurance company class is capable of:
- Calculate the MCR and SCR of an insurance company under different scenarios.
- Perform stress tests on the SCR of the insurance company under different market and operational risk scenarios.
- Update the reinsurance terms for an IORP.
- Implements a risk mitigation strategy to reduce the potential impact of market volatility on the IORP's investments.

The IORP class is capable of:
- Calculate the net asset value (NAV) of the IORP.
- Calculate the current market value of the IORP's assets.
- Calculate the risk profile of the IORP based on its solvency ratio, asset diversification, and industry risk.
- Implement a risk mitigation strategy for the IORP such as stop loss and delta hedging.

The interaction class between the two institutions is capable of:
- Determine the reinsurance amount based on the size and financial stability of the IORP.
- Determine IORP risk profile based on different factors.
- Update the contract length based on the interest rate.
- Calculate solvency ratio of IORP as the ratio of the total assets to the technical provisions and act accordingly.
